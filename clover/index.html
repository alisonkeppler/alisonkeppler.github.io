					<h3>RESEARCH.</h3>
					<p>After reviewing the current site (pictured below) and <span class="span-three italic">diving into those for others operating in similar or related markets</span>, including other local food trucks and vegetarian and vegan establishments, I honed in on the need for a site that more clearly depicts the healthy ingredients Clover uses and the range of offerings the company provides, without some of the additional information currently taking up valuable real estate on Clover’s homepage. I also factored in <span class="span-three italic">feedback from user conversations</span>, which addressed frustration with the cluttered nature of the page and the need for greater emphasis on Clover’s specific offerings. </p>

					<h3>WIREFRAMES.</h3>
					<p>Putting (erasable) pen to paper. This was an initial framework for how I envisioned a landing page developing: <span class="span-three italic"> calling clear attention to Clover’s mission</span> and highlighting locations and menus, with everything else as an added perk. These are the final wireframes, after iterating on earlier versions <span class="span-three italic">based on user feedback</span> for optimal section ordering and additional content to includes as subpages.</p>

					<h3>DESIGN.</h3>
					<p>After putting concepts in front of additional users, <span class="span-three italic">editing some of the navigation and content based on their feedback</span>, and settling on a direction, the final mockup below clearly demonstrates opportunities for the site’s enhancement and optimization. This re-design incorporates a lighter and brighter feel and tone, drawing in the Boston community with a landing page that truly reflects Clover’s vibrant personality and offerings.</p>

					<h3>VALIDATE.</h3>
					<p>Due to the fact that this project was a creative concept only, and not a paid assignment from the client, I was unable to officially implement any of these ideas or make any changes live on the site for testing. However, <span class="span-three italic">through user interviews discussing the new design elements</span>, I was able to verify that these updates would be well received within the target audience. Additionally, if I did have the opportunity to launch any updates, I would <span class="span-three italic">monitor the results through key performance indicators specific to the priority goals</span>: for example, to measure the user’s ability to locate different pages on the site, I would evaluate Google analytics for bounce rates and user flows to identify disconnects and drop-offs.</p>
